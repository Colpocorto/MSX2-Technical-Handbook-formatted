# MSX2 Technical Handbook

This is the full reference of [the MSX2 system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) as published by [ASCII Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_Corporation) in 1987. I converted it to text files in 1997 (the OCR used consisted of my eyes and my fingers) and now here it is in markdown format for easier browsing and reading. There's also the KunBASIC (also known as Turbo-BASIC) compiler reference as a bonus.

These are the book chapters:

* [Chapter 1: MSX system overview](md/Chapter1.md)

The original text files are in [the txt folder](txt), unmodified since I first published them in [konamiman.com](http://www.konamiman.com) except that I have converted all tabs to spaces.


### Contributing

This is a finished project, and no further changes will be made in principle unless typos or mistakes are found. However, it would be nice to convert the ASCII tables and figures to nice-looking pictures, as they were originally in the printed book. So if you feel like doing that... go for it, your pull request(s) will be more than welcome.
